All animals

    Snowball = Pig('Snowball')
    Boxer = Horse('Boxer')

are equal

  

    if Snowball == Boxer:
      print True
    
    if Boxer == Snowball:
      print True

but some are more equal than others.

    (Snowball == Boxer) < (Boxer == Snowball) # True
    (Snowball == Boxer) > (Boxer == Snowball) # False
